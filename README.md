Generic-RPG
===========

This was my first big c++ project, however the original code was absolutely awful.  Now it is a remake, primarily used to demonstrate various c++ concepts (as well as general programming aptitude) while also giving a moderately enjoyable play-experience.  Have fun and I hope you appreciate the code!
